## Who we are

We're a group of coders who work in the industry and like to help bring new talent into the field. Our tutors work in a range of industries including web development and engineering. We remember what it's like starting out, the frustration of not getting it and the uncertainty of where to turn to for help. We'd like to be your one stop resource for all things code. Based in the heart of the Gold Coast, Australia and able to come to you.
